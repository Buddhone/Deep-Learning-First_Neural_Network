# Your-First-Neural-Network

First project of Udacity's Deep Learning Nanodegree

Point of attention:

1) Learning rate --> Proposed value of 0.1 found a bit too slow, testing with other values, submitting 0.8
2) Hidden Layers number, decided to go for a power of 2 here (16) with a number inbetween Input Layer and output layer 
3) Number of epochs set to 5000 as it provides a reasonable accuracy
